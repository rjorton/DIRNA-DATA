# DIRNA-DATA
DI-RNA deletion, coverage and reference files for various SRA BioProjects

One folder per BioProject: contains ref.fasta reference sequence

Within each BioPorject, one folder for each SRA run: contains a coverage.txt file and dels_map files

Uniform dels_map files represent the original sample's DIRNA files with the co-ordinates changed based on alignment on the reference sequence to the Hutchinson project refernece sequence - to enable easier comparisons between divergent reference sequences.
